Sightseer16165657825,,,Hotel or breakfast was good.,"From the very beginning, it was good that the staff opened the door and brought in the luggage. It was in front of Mikkevich, so the scenery was good, and when you went to the nearby ladder, you could go on a good path. The hotel booked the room as a family room and I don't know if there was no room, but it was nice to give you two rooms. As soon as I went, the service fruit was delicious and the bed was full. The bathroom wasn't bad, and TV was good for being YouTube. Simple water or snacks should be purchased, but it was good to be able to pay at once when you leave immediately after an accident without going down to a convenience shop. There are many restaurants nearby and breakfast was not bad. Overall good and if you are thinking of going on a walk to the Mickey Beach, I recommend it.",Date of stay:,5.0
